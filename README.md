# Introduction 
This is a very old jQuery plugin I wrote for the hotel company I used to work for. We were trying to integrate things from the TripAdvisor API to our own sites. Since I had to deal with technological constraints at the times with the lousy CMS system we used that limited my server calling abilities, I resorted to using a jQuery plugin which TripAdvisor themselves didn't have much of a problem with.
